# Spacekapto
2D (Actually 3D) game made with Unity! It was heavily inspired by the infamous "Space Impact" game in the old Nokia phones. I wanted to get my hands dirty with unity (in prep for Daydream VR), and this was a great way to start. Simple 2D game made with no external libraries, just a whole
lot of love :grin:
